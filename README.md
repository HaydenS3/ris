# RIS Project

Author: Hayden Schroeder

## Overview

Need to test the RIS cluster and get a better understanding of how it works. I plan to use [Kaggle's Digit Recognizer challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer/overview) to test the RIS cluster. I see two opportunities for parallelization:

1. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Generate 300+ hyperparameter combinations and run the jobs separately to find hyperparameters with the best performance.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Split up the dataset to perform preprocessing across multiple jobs.
